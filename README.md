# MAKE

There are two folders. One is for mandatory, and the other is bonus.

```shell
$ cd philo
$ make
```

or

```shell
$ cd philo_bonus
$ make
```

You can see how to use this program after type `make` on your terminal.
The difference between mandatory and bonus is just using mutex or semaphores.
